# Project_4


Overview: 
In this project we used Machine Learning and Neural Networks to predict whether a person has diabetes or not with various different types of symptoms such as HbA1c Level, Blood Glucose Level, Body Mass Index (BMI), Age, Gender, Hypertension, Heart Disease, and Smoking History. As there are many symptoms that can be in effect to diabetes, the two main things to accurately diagnose someone with diabetes is by their HbA1c level and Blood Glucose Level. The project is based on a Kaggle “Diabetes Prediction Dataset”, (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iammustafatz/diabetes-prediction-dataset/data). According to https://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/managing/managing-blood-sugar/a1c.html#:~:text=A%20normal%20A1C%20level%20is,for%20developing%20type%202%20diabetes, if your HbA1c level is in the range of 5.7% and below you’re non-diabetic, when your level ranges from 5.7%-6.4% you’re prediabetic, and when you’re considered diabetic your level is 6.5% or higher. According to https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/diabetes/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20371451#:~:text=A%20fasting%20blood%20sugar%20level,Glucose%20tolerance%20test, if your blood glucose level is 100 mg or less you are non-diabetic, if your level ranges from 100-125 mg you’re prediabetic, and if you’re 126 mg or higher you’re considered to be diabetic.

Tools:
Pandas, Keras Tuner, Seaborn, Scikit Learn, Numpy, Matplotlib, 

Final Results:
When using the Random Forest classifier the predictions of someone not having diabetes was at 97% and those who did have diabetes at 96%.
